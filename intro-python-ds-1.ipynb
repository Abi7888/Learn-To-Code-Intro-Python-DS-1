    "# Welcome to Introduction to Python for Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick overview of some basic concepts in Python, applied for the field of data science. This course is designed by the Galvanize community. Feel free to download, fork, and work with it as you please!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## In this course you will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Set up your computer\n",
    "* Setting up iPython/Jupyter\n",
    "* Basic Python commands \n",
    "* Explorations in NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib\n",
    "* Sandbox time!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gut check, Galvanize-style!\n",
    "\n",
    "* This course is for beginners\n",

    "## What IS Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "The language of Python was created by Guido Van Rossum in the 1990s, and yes, it is totally named after Monty Python.\n",
    "Presently, the growth and adoption of the language is a an enormous open-source project with a huge worldwide community.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why do we learn Python for data science?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an easy to learn, general-purpose, scalable language with popular libraries such as:\n",
    "* SciPy.org (Math, Science, Engineering)\n",
    "* StatsModels (Statistics)\n",
    "* Pandas (Frameworks)\n",
    "* SciKit-Learn (Machine Learning)\n",

    "## Let's set up your computer!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Install Anaconda.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda from Continuum Analytics provides virtually everything you need to get started in data science. Go to [continuum.io/downloads](https://continuum.io/downloads) and follow the instructions in the website - they vary per platform. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Install Git (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need a command line prompt to launch Anaconda's Jupyter Notebooks for this lesson. We recommend Git in case you're interested in version control or cloud deployment in the future. Go to [git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and follow the directions there.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Activate your Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to use Jupyter, formerly known as IPython, which is short for “Interactive Python.” This is a way for you to code within a browser in a faster, interactive way.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open up your Git terminal\n",
    "2. Navigate to your working directory\n",
    "3. Type “jupyter notebook” into the prompt\n",
    "4. Some computation should happen...\n",
    "5. Go to your browser and type in this URL: http://localhost:8888/ (this may launch anyway)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you see a new browser tab pop up, create a \"New\" notebook in the top right corner. Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Python Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to use this notebook to engage more actively with Python! For ease, I've created all the commands for you, but I recommend that you practice typing your own as well to get the \"feel\" for how a data scientist operates. *Learn by doing!*"
